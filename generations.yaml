    description: "The Citroën ë-C4 X is an electric fastback sedan variant of the ë-C4, featuring a distinctive body style that blends elements of a traditional sedan with SUV-inspired ground clearance and a coupe-like sloping roofline. Built on Stellantis' e-CMP platform, it's longer than the standard ë-C4 by approximately 240mm, primarily benefiting the rear overhang and creating a 510-liter trunk (versus 380 liters in the standard model). The powertrain is identical to the ë-C4, consisting of a front-mounted electric motor producing 136 HP (100 kW) and 260 Nm of torque, paired with a 50 kWh lithium-ion battery. This setup provides a WLTP range of up to 360 km (224 miles), slightly improved over the standard ë-C4 due to better aerodynamics. Charging capabilities include support for up to 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 0-80% charge in about 30 minutes. The interior is largely shared with the ë-C4, featuring Citroën's 'Advanced Comfort' seats, a 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and comprehensive driver assistance technologies. The suspension utilizes Progressive Hydraulic Cushions for exceptional ride comfort, a key brand differentiator. The ë-C4 X was developed primarily for markets where sedans remain popular, particularly Southern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, offering a distinctive alternative that combines the practicality of a sedan trunk with crossover styling elements and zero-emission electric propulsion. Unlike the standard C4, which offers both combustion and electric powertrains in most European markets, the C4 X is available exclusively as an electric vehicle in many Western European countries, reflecting the accelerating transition to electrification."
